Hi here we are. 
This is the release alpha version of SupaJim.

* HOW TO INSTALL SupaJim *

Extract the zip file into a nice-looking directory. Then put the graphics (*.bmp) into a folder named Graphics and the SDL.dll either into the Windows\SYSTEM folder or into the same folder as the SupaJim.exe.

enjoy yourself playing :-)
